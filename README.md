#Load Balancers & Discrete Event Simulations

##ABSTRACT
During development of network architecture, researchers in most cases use simulations for evaluation of their product before implementing it in a real world scenario. This is as true in the area of communication networks as it is in the area of aircraft. The assignment provided by Dr Dhaini is an invaluable lesson for undergraduates students (such as ourselves), as it allows us to explore network architecture and simulation from the very core of the field: the design and software implementation of a real-life simple network topology. This project also allowed us to have a firm understanding of discrete event simulation, which extends to nearly all fields that require simulations to test products, not only the network field.We present the network topology required using the OMNeT++ discrete event simulator, which enables efficient modeling of large-scale network architecture.

This project was conducted under the supervision of Professor [Ahmad Dhaini](http://staff.aub.edu.lb/~ad57/).

##INTRODUCTION

Communication systems are growing in size and complexity, and govern almost every aspect of our lives. We notice people around us always connected, and the emergence of the Internet of Things and the never ending growth of the Internet and communication systems will shape the lives of people even further in the future.Being able to simulate a network is a key skill that every software architect and engineer needs to acquire in order for him to join the journey of designing and building a more connected world. 

The purpose of this project was of two fold: first to make us familiar with discrete event simulation, a powerful technique used in multiple industries; second, learn how a load balancers work.2.

##OMNET++ AND THE NETWORK DESIGN“

OMNeT++ is an extensible, modular, component-based C++ simulation library and framework, primarily for building network simulators.” [omnetpp.org]

After we were assigned to implement the network topology, a fair amount of time was dedicated to the only purpose of understanding discrete event simulations. 

OMNeT++ on two different operating systems: Mac OS X and Windows 10 before we immerse ourselves in the study of the user guide.

To avoid confusion during submission, we decided to implement the network on both platforms and submit two versions of our network simulation.
